Kallakurichi's history spans ancient dynasties to its recent establishment as a district.
Historically, the region was part of the Chola, Pallava, and local chieftaindoms, later falling under the control of the Gingee Nayaks and Arcot Nawabs.
During British rule, it was part of South Arcot District. Kallakurichi town itself became a town panchayat in 1960, 
evolving into a municipality in 2004 and then a first-grade municipality in 2010.
   The district was officially created on November 12, 2019, by bifurcating Viluppuram District.
